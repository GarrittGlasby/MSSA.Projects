# MSSA.Projects

This is a project file for my time in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. 
During this course I learnt C#, SQL, ASP.NET MVC, and Azure Fundamentals.
It is a 19 week program that has you utilize an agile approach to creating an application from start to finish,
utilizing ASP.NET MVC and the .NET framework. 
You then launch it to the Azure cloud.

This folder also has all projects that were completed while in the program and whiteboard problems that we received during our 45 minute technical mock interviews.
